# Installation Guide

Choose the path that matches your Unreal Engine version and workflow.

## Quick Install

```bash
# Inside Unreal's bundled Python — one command per engine version
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.5\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -m pip install dcc-mcp-unreal
```

The plugin auto-detects the running engine and activates the correct capability
tier. For older engines without a bundled Python, install a sidecar Python
environment (see [UE 4.18](#ue-418-native-baseline)).

---

## UE Version Matrix

| UE Version | Install Mode | Required Python | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **4.18** | C++ plugin + external sidecar | System Python 3.7+ (or 3.12 in CI) | No `PythonScriptPlugin`; Python tools run in external sidecar |
| **4.27 – 5.0** | C++ plugin + `PythonScriptPlugin` | Engine-bundled Python 3.7 / 3.9 | Enable the plugin in Editor |
| **5.1 – 5.7** | C++ plugin + `PythonScriptPlugin` | Engine-bundled Python 3.9 / 3.11 | Full DCC MCP skill catalog |
| **5.8+** | C++ plugin + `PythonScriptPlugin` + optional Epic MCP bridge | Engine-bundled Python 3.11+ | DCC MCP tools + bridge to Epic's `ModelContextProtocol` plugin |

### Per-Tier Detail

**UE 4.18 (native baseline)**
The C++ plugin builds with Visual Studio 2017 Build Tools and MSVC 14.16.
Python skills need an external sidecar; install `dcc-mcp-unreal` into a
system Python and run the server outside the editor. See the
[MSVC-Kit guide](msvc-kit-guide.md#unreal-engine-418) for the tested
toolchain.

**UE 4.27 – 5.7 (Python-enabled)**
Full DCC MCP server inside the editor. Install `dcc-mcp-unreal` into the
engine's bundled Python, enable `PythonScriptPlugin`, and the server runs
in-process. The C++ plugin handles subprocess lifecycle and main-thread
dispatch.

**UE 5.8+ (Epic MCP bridge)**
All DCC MCP capabilities remain available. The `unreal-official-mcp` skill
can optionally bridge Epic's installed `ModelContextProtocol` plugin —
discover and call Epic tools through the same MCP endpoint without
redistribution. Keep the Epic plugin installed with the engine; the adapter
detects and calls its loopback endpoint only.

---

## Pip Install (per Engine Version)

Each Unreal Engine ships a self-contained Python interpreter. Install
directly into it with one command. Replace the engine path to match your
installed version.

### UE 5.5 / 5.4 / 5.3 (Python 3.11)

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.5\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -m pip install dcc-mcp-unreal
```

For engine versions with `python.exe` missing from the ThirdParty directory,
first enable the **Python Editor Script Plugin** (Edit → Plugins → search
"Python"), restart the editor, then use the editor's own Python:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.4\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe" ^
    "C:\Path\To\YourProject.uproject" -run=pythonscript -script="path\to\install.py" -stdout -unattended -nosplash
```

### UE 5.2 / 5.1 (Python 3.9)

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.2\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -m pip install dcc-mcp-unreal
```

### UE 5.0 / 4.27 (Python 3.9 / 3.7)

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.0\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -m pip install dcc-mcp-unreal
```

### UE 4.18 (External Sidecar)

UE 4.18 has no embedded Python. Install into a system Python and connect
the agent to the sidecar server:

```bash
pip install dcc-mcp-unreal
```

Then start the server from a Python script outside the editor, pointing at
the UE 4.18 project. The native C++ plugin handles the automation bridge.

### Development Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcc-mcp/dcc-mcp-unreal
cd dcc-mcp-unreal
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Uplugin Deployment

Download a pre-built plugin ZIP from GitHub Releases and copy it into your
project or engine installation.

### From GitHub Releases

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/dcc-mcp/dcc-mcp-unreal/releases)
2. Download the ZIP matching your engine: `DccMcpUnreal-0.2.0-ue5.7.zip`,
   `DccMcpUnreal-0.2.0-ue5.8.zip`, or `DccMcpUnreal-0.2.0-ue4.18.zip`
3. Extract into your project or engine:

**Project plugin** (recommended — keeps the engine clean):
```
MyProject/
├── MyProject.uproject
└── Plugins/
    └── DccMcpUnreal/       ← extract here
        ├── DccMcpUnreal.uplugin
        ├── Content/
        ├── python/
        └── ...
```

**Engine plugin** (shared across all projects on this engine):
```
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Plugins\DccMcpUnreal\
```

4. Open your project in Unreal Editor
5. **Edit → Plugins → search "DCC MCP Unreal"** → enable the plugin
6. Restart the editor

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone and build the plugin package
git clone https://github.com/dcc-mcp/dcc-mcp-unreal
cd dcc-mcp-unreal
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build for your engine (adjust UE_ROOT)
set UE_ROOT=C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7
vx just package             # builds to dist/DccMcpUnreal/
vx just package-zip         # builds + creates ZIP archive

# Deploy directly into a project
vx just deploy "C:\Path\To\MyProject"
```

CI builds the uplugin for UE 5.7, UE 5.8, and UE 4.18 automatically on
every release. The UE 4.18 artifact is Python-only (no native module
compiled).

---

## Enable the Python Plugin

For UE 4.27+:

1. Open your Unreal Engine project
2. **Edit → Plugins → search "Python"**
3. Enable **"Python Editor Script Plugin"**
4. Restart the editor

The `PythonScriptPlugin` dependency in `DccMcpUnreal.uplugin` is marked
`Optional: true` — the native plugin loads on older engines even when
the Python plugin is absent.

---

## Verification

### Smoke Test (Quick)

Open Unreal Editor's **Output Log → Python** console and run:

```python
import dcc_mcp_unreal
handle = dcc_mcp_unreal.start_server()
print(handle.mcp_url())   # e.g. http://127.0.0.1:9876/mcp
```

Connect any MCP client to the printed URL. The server auto-selects a free
OS-assigned port.

### Native Automation Test (CI-grade)

```bash
# Run inside the editor with UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe
vx just ue-smoke "C:\Path\To\YourProject"
```

Runs the native Unreal Automation Test `DccMcp.Smoke.ServerStarts`, verifies
HTTP readiness, and confirms the built-in tools are registered. Reports are
written to `Saved/Automation/Reports`.

### CLI Discovery

If `dcc-mcp-cli` is installed:

```bash
dcc-mcp-cli list              # list live DCC sessions (should show Unreal)
dcc-mcp-cli dcc-types         # list supported DCC types in the release catalog
```

The stable gateway is at `http://127.0.0.1:9765/mcp`. The CLI resolves it
automatically; pass the direct instance URL if you need to bypass the
gateway.

### pip Install Verification

```bash
# From the engine's Python, confirm the package imports cleanly
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -c "import dcc_mcp_unreal; print(dcc_mcp_unreal.__version__)"
```

Expected output: `0.2.0` (or the installed version).

## Agent-Oriented Installation

When an AI agent needs to install `dcc-mcp-unreal` programmatically, use
the single-command paths below. These assume the standard engine install
location; adjust the path if your engine is elsewhere.

### Agent Quick Path

```bash
# Detect and install into the newest UE engine on the machine
for /D %e in ("C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_*") do if exist "%e\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" "%e\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -m pip install dcc-mcp-unreal
```

**PowerShell equivalent:**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_*" -Directory |
    ForEach-Object { $py = Join-Path $_.FullName "Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe"
                     if (Test-Path $py) { & $py -m pip install dcc-mcp-unreal } }
```

### Verifying Dependencies

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -m pip show dcc-mcp-unreal
```

Expected output includes:
```
Name: dcc-mcp-unreal
Version: 0.2.0
Requires: dcc-mcp-core>=0.19.45,<1.0.0
```

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DCC_MCP_UNREAL_SKILL_PATHS` | built-in skills only | Semicolon-delimited paths to custom skill directories |
| `DCC_MCP_UNREAL_PORT` | OS-assigned (`0`) | Override the MCP instance port |
| `DCC_MCP_UNREAL_SERVER_NAME` | `unreal-mcp` | Server display name |
| `DCC_MCP_SERVER_EXECUTABLE` | auto-discovered | Override path to `dcc-mcp-server` binary |
| `DCC_MCP_UNREAL_PYTHON_PLUGIN` | `PythonScriptPlugin` | Python plugin dependency name in `.uplugin` |
| `UE_ROOT` | `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.2` | Engine root (for `vx just package`) |
| `DCC_MCP_CORE_SPEC` | `dcc-mcp-core>=0.18.7,<1.0.0` | Core version spec (for plugin builds) |

Set environment variables before the editor starts. Example:

```bash
set DCC_MCP_UNREAL_SKILL_PATHS=C:\studio\skills;C:\shared\pipeline\skills
set DCC_MCP_UNREAL_PORT=9000
```

Then start Unreal Editor — the server picks up these values on module init.

## Distribution Channels

| Channel | What You Get | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **PyPI** | `dcc-mcp-unreal` wheel (pure Python + entry points) | pip install into any Python environment |
| **GitHub Releases** | `.whl` + `.zip` archives per engine version | Manual deployment, air-gapped setups |
| **GitHub Actions CI** | `python-dist` artifact (wheel+sdist), `DccMcpUnreal-*-ue*.zip` artifacts | CI/CD pipeline integration |
| **Source** | `git clone` + `pip install -e .` | Development and customization |

---

## Troubleshooting

### `pip install` can't find the engine's `python.exe`

Some UE versions don't ship a standalone `python.exe` in the ThirdParty
directory by default. Enable the Python Editor Script Plugin inside Unreal
Editor first, restart, then the engine registers the Python environment.

### Plugin doesn't appear in the Plugins list

- Confirm the `Plugins/DccMcpUnreal/` directory is directly under your
  project root (not nested one level deeper).
- The `.uplugin` file must be at `Plugins/DccMcpUnreal/DccMcpUnreal.uplugin`.
- Regenerate the project files: right-click the `.uproject` in Explorer →
  "Generate Visual Studio project files" (or run `UnrealVersionSelector.exe`).

### MCP server starts but CLI can't discover it

- Ensure `dcc-mcp-cli` is installed and up-to-date:
  ```bash
  dcc-mcp-cli update check
  dcc-mcp-cli update apply
  ```
- Check the stable gateway port: `curl http://127.0.0.1:9765/mcp`
- If the gateway is down, connect directly to the instance URL printed
  by `handle.mcp_url()`.

### C++ compilation errors (FTicker, etc.)

UE 5.7+ deprecated older APIs. Make sure you are using the plugin version
built for your engine. The `build-uplugin` CI builds per-engine artifacts;
do not cross-deploy a UE 5.2 uplugin into UE 5.7.

### Python `dcc-mcp-core` version mismatch

`dcc-mcp-unreal` pins `dcc-mcp-core>=0.19.45,<1.0.0`. If a newer core
broke compatibility, pin the known-good version:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -m pip install "dcc-mcp-core>=0.19.45,<0.20.0"
```

### Engine Python pip TLS / SSL errors

Older engine Python builds may have outdated `certifi`. Upgrade pip and
certifi before the main install:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.2\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Python3\Win64\python.exe" -m pip install --upgrade pip certifi
```

## Next Steps

- Read the [Unreal version compatibility contract](unreal-version-compatibility.md)
  for capability gating details
- Follow the [README Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) to start the
  server and connect an agent
- Browse [built-in skills](../src/dcc_mcp_unreal/skills/) to see available
  MCP tools
- Read the [MSVC-Kit guide](msvc-kit-guide.md) if you need to build the
  C++ plugin from source for UE 4.18
